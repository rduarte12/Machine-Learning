# Machine Learning

This repository contains code implementations based on the book **"Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and PyTorch"**. Each directory corresponds to the main technology or technique learned in each chapter of the book.

> **Note:** Personal notes are kept in a private notebook for now, but may be published here in the future.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own learning journey.
